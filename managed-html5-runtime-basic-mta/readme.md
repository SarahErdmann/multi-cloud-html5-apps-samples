## Description

This is an example of an HTML5 app that is managed by SAP Cloud Platform and is integrated into a SAP Cloud Launchpad. The app is deployed to the HTML5 Application Repository and uses the Authentication & Authorization service (XSUAA service) and the destination service.

## Download and Deployment
1. Subscribe to the [launchpad service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html) if you haven't done so before.
1. Download the source code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-nodejs-codejam/multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples
    cd multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples/managed-html5-runtime-mta-hello-world
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
3. Deploy the project:
    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/hello-world_1.0.0.mtar
    ```

If the deployment has been successful, you will be able to form the URL of the app based on the URL of launchpad. It will have the following structure: <https://[globalaccount-id].launchpad.cfapps.[region].hana.ondemand.com/myservice.helloworld/index.html>
