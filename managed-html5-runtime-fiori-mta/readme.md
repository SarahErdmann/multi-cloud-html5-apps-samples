## Diagram

![diagram](diagram.png)


## Description

This is an example of an SAP Fiori app that is managed by SAP Cloud Platform. The SAP Fiori app is exposed to an SAP Cloud Platform Launchpad and visible to the content manager of the launchpad. The app is deployed to the HTML5 Application Repository and uses the Authentication & Authorization service (XSUAA service) and the destination service. 

The web app that is contained in the `uimodule.zip` defines the following properties in the `manifest.json` file. Otherwise, the correspoding values in the `mta.yaml` descriptor need to be updated as well.

```JSON
{
  "sap.cloud": {
    "public": true,
    "service": "cloud.service"
  },
  "sap.app": {
    "id": "com.myorg.FLP",
    "applicationVersion": {
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Download and Deployment
1. Subscribe to the [launchpad service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html) if you haven't done so before.
1. Download the source code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-nodejs-codejam/multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples
    cd multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples/managed-html5-runtime-launchpad-mta
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
3. Deploy the project:
    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/managed_launchpad_1.0.0.mtar
    ```

If the deployment has been successful, you will be able to form the URL of the app based on the URL of launchpad. It will have the following structure: <https://[globalaccount-id].launchpad.cfapps.[region].hana.ondemand.com/cloudservice.commyorgFLP/flpSandbox.html#Shell-home>
